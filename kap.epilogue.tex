\chapter{Epilogue}

So here I am.
I finally got around converting the original log book into digital media.
It took me 2 years to sit down and finish it.

It was fun to see how much I remembered when taking down the words and trying to make sense of the rushed English I jotted down on the pages.
Was a bit complicated to type the stuff I stapled over with tickets.
Maybe I will scan those in some time.
Maybe not.
One of the tickets bleached out completely.
I am unable to make out what it originally was for.
Obviously paper can forget stuff too.

Now, as I get older, I wonder if I will write another of these things some day.
I suppose so.
The question is: From where?
And when?

Life sure got a lot more crowded in the last two years.

Whoever you might be when reading this, even if you are an older version of myself, remember this:

\emph{Keep the toilet paper safe}.
