\chapter{Week Three}

% 31th October til 6th November

\paragraph{31. October, about Midnight; Peppers Resort, Apartment 314}
The pen is down in the car, once again I am back up to using pencil.

It was a long day of driving, we destroyed roughly 600km of linear distance.
Hoghlights weren an overly zealous construction project along the way.
We passed about half a dozen road works.
Also we crossed a dozen rail tracks which seemed to belong to the sugar cane cartel whose sugar cane plantations we were driving though.
Other than that there was a huge amount of coast and traffic and - well - a lot of driving involved.

At our destination we took three attempts to find the place where we could check-in for the boat cruise tomorrow.

The hotel room we got is extremely nice, with a bathtub of monstrous proportions, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a spaceous balcony.

\paragraph{31. October, about Noon; Aboard the Iceberg}
We have set out to sea.
Weather is great.
I do not know the nautical term but I would say sunny with a little wind.
Sea is calm.
Not that it matters much, we are only doing some freshwater pirating anyways.
We have got two men looking to us not getting lost on or off the boat.
Skipper seems to have done this his whole life.
Only reason he takes passengers at the moment seems to be that he ran out of money.
Hard to understand by Swiss standards.
Easygoing folk in this country.

Apparently the ship needs about five people to set sail but only about 2 to operate it once propery prepared.
Michael and me got the honors of pulling up the sail.
Luckily there was barely any wind.
We have had a hard time as it was.
Besides the five of us and the crew, we have got another 6 people on board.
There is what appears to be two couples and two women. Scotsgirls, Germans and some other nationalities.
Might look into that later.

It is a pretty quiet mode of transportation unless you need to start the diesel engine.
But with the current weather, enjoying the quiet on deck will lead to sunburn pretty quickly.

Thus I am writing this below deck.
Partly because there is nothing table-like above, and partly because I would manage to toss both log book and pen overboard somehow.

Some things, however, still loom above the cruise.
The toilet is electric and ca not handle much besides human endproduct and a little toilet paper.
An the shower is integrated into the tiolet and you have to pump the box dry afterwards.

Also a lesson for shipbuilders.
Stoves on a ship need to be hanging freely.
Otherwise everything will just tip over in rough sea.

\paragraph{31. October, Afternoon; Aboard the Iceberg}
We have had a casualty.
Well, actually two casualties.
The Preceptress stubbed her toe when boarding the byboat.
Looks like some sort of familiy curse.
Red October seems to have trouble getting on small boats as well.
Second casualty is perception of time.
I am pretty sure it is afternoon, but my main indicator is Rod (the first-and-only-mate) preparing dinner.

We have done some snorkeling in a fish laden bay - Blue Pearl Bay.
With all the coral, shimmering fish and strange little red floaty stuff.
We have agreed the floaty stuff is \emph{not} fish poo.
We also suspect we are the only ones who have brought booze on board.
Everyone else is just too darn responsible.
I suspect we will have to pay a round tonight.

Secondly, we were marooned on a deserted sand bank for an hour of forced relaxing.
Sunburn imminent.

\paragraph{1. November, Noon; Aboard the Iceberg}
Had a good night's sleep aboard.
We were anchoring in a quiet bay somewhere north of the whole Whitsunday area.
I kept waking up to the sound of water splashing up against the hull.
Bunk was lacking height too.
I kept bumping into the ceiling.

The nightsky the eve before was beautiful.
It was not dark enough to see the milky way but there were hell of a lot of stars.
Actually \emph{everyone} brought booze, so no issues there.

Breakfast was good, then we went for another snorkeling tour.
More reef this time, more diverse fish too.

The Gadgeteer got seasick, woke up with a headache and discarded breakfast.
Got him to recuperate on the beach during the land trip.
He is not sick any more.
Still has some of a headache.

Saw a snake, a few manta rays and beach sharks and some turtles.
For some reason The Preceptress goes nuts for turtles.
Now it is time for lunch and some light sailing.
Home harbour awaits.

\paragraph{1. November, 17:55; Peppers, Room 114}
We are back at base camp.
There was some 30° dailing, The Gadgeteer got better but us now sunburnt.
Red October secured a Scottish phone number and a French meeting tonight at 8.
Other than that everyone was glad to get back and showered.
The Preceptress tested the hotel pool.
And we had to phone the reception to get our fifth bed and the luggage we deposited during the ship trip.

\paragraph{2. November, 14:00; Road to Rockhampton}
We are on the road.
Again.
Going another 500km south.
Not much difference in the landscape from the previous drive.
Grasslands, trees and sugar cane everywhere.

Yesterday evening we concluded the day by going drinking with the French traveleress we met on the boat.
General fun was had even though the live music was loud and we ran into the language abrrier a few times.
We were not going very fast, so no harm done.

Well, back to watching the landscape zip by.

\paragraph{2. November, 15:20; Road to Rockhampton}
We just passed road side sign trivia.
The largest mountain in Queensland seems to be Mount Bartle Frere.
There is disappointingly little content.
There was but a single trivia question.
Nobody knew the question anyway.

\paragraph{2. November, 18:00; Villa Mar Colina, \emph{Penthouse}}
We got to Yeppoon.
We checked in.
We got an upgrade\dots{} \emph{Penthouse}, baby!
Downside: We only have three queen sizre beds.
Downside: The spa is out of order.
Upside: We got the bloody \emph{Penthouse}.
The Gadgeteer just ran around photo-documenting the whole salon\footnote{about as big as my whole flat}, the veranda\footnote{about as big as my whole flat}, the upper deck terrace\footnote{about as big as my whole flat} and the batchrooms next to the main bedroom\footnote{about as big as my whole flat}.
There is a giant TV, a sofa that seats 8+, a kitchen\footnote{about as big as my whole flat}. Okay maybe I \emph{am} exaggerating a little\ldots{} but we got the bloody \emph{Penthouse}!
Tonight will be take-away thai and Jack Daniels.
Just a bloody drop of extra luck and we would be slurping Margeritas in the jaccuzzi.
We even got an ice machine with crusher.

\paragraph{2. November, 12:05; Villa Mar Colina, \emph{Penthouse}}
Fetched Thai food\footnote{take-away} for dinner.
Once again we disregard the 15AU\$ rule and ordered way too much.
Anyways, we filled up and ate way too hot as well.
We got the food up the 45 degrees sloped road the current hotel is built on and the spicy food soaked mny shirt.
First action after dinner: shower.

And once again we run into timing issues because Aussies only work until 4pm or so resulting in very hard-to-meet deadlines for check-ins or car-pickups in the afternoon.
Particulary when you are traveling during the whole day.

At least engineering once more provides us with internet access.

The toilet paper has taken quite a beating so far.
I think the salt water spray is targeting one of the roll's weaknesses.

\paragraph{3. November, 10:30; Road to Hervey Bay}
Elvis has left the Penthouse.
Breakfast, packing, checkout.
As always, we are back on the road.

Also, we have just enterd a road with a sign: "Slow trucks - carrying explosives - next 2km".
Then we passed road works and while we waited a truck drove by carrying a dozen bags full of ammonium nitrate\ldots{}
Followed by a truck carrying cement.
Our guess is if the former actually explodes, the latter can just fill on the crater reducing the impact on the following traffic to a minimum.
Hmm, I wonder why there is a road works right at this location.

\paragraph{3. November, 22:15; Fraser Lodge Holiday Park}
I have done some more driving today.
Aussies drive on the left, so it is advisable to follow their example.
I have never driven an automatic shift before, so Red October is explaining to me when to engage the park gear.
Adter in depth analysis, I conclude he just wants to convert me to his driving religion.

Bit if an embarassment are the armatures, since they are mirrored.
Hence I sometimes wipe the front shield instead of signalling.
This identifies me as 100\% genuine tourist, which luckily, I am.
