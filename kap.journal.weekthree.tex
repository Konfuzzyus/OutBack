\chapter{Week Three}

% 31th October til 6th November

\paragraph{31. October, about Midnight; Peppers Resort, Apartment 314}
The pen is down in the car, once again I am back up to using pencil.

It was a long day of driving, we destroyed roughly 600km of linear distance.
Hoghlights weren an overly zealous construction project along the way.
We passed about half a dozen road works.
Also we crossed a dozen rail tracks which seemed to belong to the sugar cane cartel whose sugar cane plantations we were driving though.
Other than that there was a huge amount of coast and traffic and - well - a lot of driving involved.

At our destination we took three attempts to find the place where we could check-in for the boat cruise tomorrow.

The hotel room we got is extremely nice, with a bathtub of monstrous proportions, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a spaceous balcony.

\paragraph{31. October, about Noon; Aboard the Iceberg}
We have set out to sea.
Weather is great.
I do not know the nautical term but I would say sunny with a little wind.
Sea is calm.
Not that it matters much, we are only doing some freshwater pirating anyways.
We have got two men looking to us not getting lost on or off the boat.
Skipper seems to have done this his whole life.
Only reason he takes passengers at the moment seems to be that he ran out of money.
Hard to understand by Swiss standards.
Easygoing folk in this country.

Apparently the ship needs about five people to set sail but only about 2 to operate it once propery prepared.
Michael and me got the honors of pulling up the sail.
Luckily there was barely any wind.
We have had a hard time as it was.
Besides the five of us and the crew, we have got another 6 people on board.
There is what appears to be two couples and two women. Scotsgirls, Germans and some other nationalities.
Might look into that later.

It is a pretty quiet mode of transportation unless you need to start the diesel engine.
But with the current weather, enjoying the quiet on deck will lead to sunburn pretty quickly.

Thus I am writing this below deck.
Partly because there is nothing table-like above, and partly because I would manage to toss both log book and pen overboard somehow.

Some things, however, still loom above the cruise.
The toilet is electric and ca not handle much besides human endproduct and a little toilet paper.
An the shower is integrated into the tiolet and you have to pump the box dry afterwards.

Also a lesson for shipbuilders.
Stoves on a ship need to be hanging freely.
Otherwise everything will just tip over in rough sea.

\paragraph{31. October, Afternoon; Aboard the Iceberg}
We have had a casualty.
Well, actually two casualties.
The Preceptress stubbed her toe when boarding the byboat.
Looks like some sort of familiy curse.
Red October seems to have trouble getting on small boats as well.
Second casualty is perception of time.
I am pretty sure it is afternoon, but my main indicator is Rod (the first-and-only-mate) preparing dinner.

We have done some snorkeling in a fish laden bay - Blue Pearl Bay.
With all the coral, shimmering fish and strange little red floaty stuff.
We have agreed the floaty stuff is \emph{not} fish poo.
We also suspect we are the only ones who have brought booze on board.
Everyone else is just too darn responsible.
I suspecz we will have to pay a round tonight.

Secondly, we were marooned on a deserted sand bank for an hour of forced relaxing.
Sunburn imminent.
