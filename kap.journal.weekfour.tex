\chapter{Week Four}

% 7th November til 13th November

\paragraph{7. November, 9:45; Highway to Gold Coast}
Writing after having had cider is lacking thoroughness.
Forgot to write about us sightseeing around Brisbane.
Lovely town, lots of flowers, fountains and parks, when you walk the right way.
They even have free outdoor swimming pools amidst ice creameries and flower laden walkways.
There are also quite a bunch of people around.
Could be because yesterday was sunday.
Also, they got quite a few architectionally interesting bridges, some reserved to cyclists and pedestrians.
And of course, the design of some of those has supposedly driven a few engineers towards insanity.

\paragraph{7. November, 22:00; Yamba Waters Holiday Park}
Just noticed I accidentally stapled two pages together.
Maybe some future generation will interpret this as some occult writing ritual - until then I will just continue logging.

Today's menu was a light walk on the Gold Coast's beaches.
However the legions of skyscraper hotels built there did not cast their shadows anyhwere useful, so The Gadgeteer ended up with another layer of sunburn.
Most prominent feature on the beach \footnote{besides the hotels lining it}, were the "no dogs allowed beyond this point" signs which were lined by dog tracks.

The second course was an expedition to a lighthouse, magnificent view of the cliffside and the seaspray.
Lots of stairclimbing involved and the lighthouse was closed for tourists without a guide.
Well\ldots{} bought a "degradable" drink there.
I hope they were referring to the bottle and not its contents, the implications seem\ldots{} unpleasant.

Between courses there was driving - once again through sugar cane fields and past sugar cane mills.
We learned to recognize a nearby sugar mill by the omnipresent smell engulfing them, of which you get sick \emph{very} quickly.
It is described as a mixture of canned corn and wet pulped wood.

To top it off, we managed to do a late check-in here.
Had to retrieve our keys and such from a pincode locked safe at the reception.
Subways for dinner.
Toilet paper rill status unchanged.

Moral is a bit moody, the end of the trip is precasting its depressing shadow.
And the dark tendrils of work are already extending their merciless grasp towards The Bomber.

Thus is the circle of life.

\paragraph{8. November, 17:25; Styx River Forest Way}
It rains once again.
We just ducked unto the car as the shower hit us.
Dry in the car now.
Not a terribly spectacular day.
Walked around in another rain forest, walked above said rain forest and drove around the same rain forest.

We have been to lookouts, looked down on some more waterfalls and drove by even more waterfalls.

And then the rain forest thing again before the word preceeding the forest came down on us.

At least \footnote{last?} we saw some wild kangaroos, some wild hares and - wait for it - a snake.
Just slithering there - all black and scaley.

On the track back a couple of cows blocked the road.
The Bomber hat to honk them off the road.

PS: Do not enter the restinf lodge on Lookout Point.
It is abuzz with flies.
They make for a somewhat unsettling atmosphere.

\paragraph{9. November, 23:55; Sydney, Travelodge}
We were driving again.
Most of the day, racing the sun to Sydney.
We were not doing anything else but driving.
Endless driving.
Even the roll of toilet paper got bored.

We only stopped a few times.
Loo breaks, refueling, more loo breaks.
At one stop I managed to soak myself by mishandling a public water spring.
I also bought tea there.
And Red October picked up an infantry magazine.
And there was a tank.
And then, more driving.

Before we ended up in Sydney City we drifted off to the Olympic Park.
It was big but lacked\ldots{} impressiveness.
Particularly the parks behind it.
We walked along a ring walkway above an abandoned quarry which was only not recycled as Olympic Park area because it had been colonized by rare frogs.
\emph{Very} rare frogs.

Then, at the hotel, the usual problem with double beds instead of twin beds and the bed sofaconundrum.
At least the Indian dinner we had was glorious.
And now they are looking for a restaurant that serves croc and kangaroo.

\paragraph{10. November, 16:55; Sydney, Travelodge Room 7043}
Sydney!
First item of business: Rain.
So we moved the Blue Mountains to tomorrow.
Or rather we moved the excursion.
So today's menu: Shopping!

We hit the lcoal mall.
Meh, they only had imported foods.
Bringing home Swiss chocolate from Australia: Fail.
The tourist traps slash souvenir shops were at least a \emph{little} more inventive.
Though they overshot a little when we browsed past the stuffed kangaroo balls\ldots{}
We secured some kangaroo jerky, some crocodile jerky and some macademia nuts\footnote(unstuffed) besides other, stranger stuff\footnote{canned plushies}.

With bags full of nonsense we ventured on.
Found out that Chinese friendship costs about 6AU\$\footnote{at the Chinese Garden of Friendship} and then we visited the Aquariam where we saw Cuttlefish\footnote{Cuthulu-Face-Fish}, Dugongs\footnote{Sea Cows}, Sharks\footnote{Tooth-Face-Fish}, Crab\footnote{Not-Fish-With-Big-Claws-And-Huge-Spindley-Legs}, Small Penguins\footnote{Sub-Bird-Marine}, Sea Horses\footnoe{Sea Horses} and water.

\paragraph{10. November, 16:55; Sydney, same room, same hotel}
Slightly tipsy.
Was unable to increase tipsyness due to Sydney closing its bottle shops at 9pm.
Horrible thing to do.
At least we got another dinner at grill'd out of it.
And we saw the Opera House.
Where the Organ needed 10 years to be built and 2 years to be tuned.
Possibly an indicator for Australian work morale.
Other than that, exploring the thing semms to the reserved for high society as most stairs are off limits for the public.
