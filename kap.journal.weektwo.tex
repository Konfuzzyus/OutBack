\chapter{Week Two}

% 24th October til 30th October

\paragraph{24. October, 7:45; Apartment B52}
It is raining.
The cold creeps in through the cracks.
We turn to the air conditioning for warmth.
Only time will tell if it helps.
Trying to boil water.
Just in case.
I hope the toaster works.

\paragraph{24. October, 9:50; Mount Gambier, Woolworths}
The Gadgeteer went to buy (another) umbrella.
The last did not survive the first time it was opened.

Started the day by visiting the sinkhole in the city center.
It looks like a giant toilet.
Consulting the plaquets mounted around it, that is more or less what the city is using it for.

\paragraph{24. October, 11:11; Road to Adelaide}
Passing through a wine lover's wet dream.
Grape plants stretch from the road to the far horizon.
The regularity of the planting patterns mesmerizes the unsuspecting eye as we speed by.

And then, after a few kilometers, we are back to sheep.

\paragraph{24. October, 22:12; Adelaide Shore Resort, Apartment 30}
Went for dinner in Glennelg.
The bridge was out so we had to take a significantly less direct route.
Turns out even a famous nightlife spot will be more or less deserted on a monday night.

Highlight was a short trip to the pier which sprung out pretty far into the dark sea and was occupied by a couple of fishing apparently Japanese guys-

\paragraph{25. October, 10:35; Flight to Alice Springs}
The weather cleared up.
Damn.
According to the forecast, we are going right into the damp cold rain in the center of bloody Red Center.
Not the kind of weather you associate with Australia.
Not the kind of wheather you associate at all.
No more time to opt out.
The dies have been cast.
Here is hoping the bloody forecast was wrong.
At least we are on a domestic flight.
No bloody immigration controls and bloody lax security.

\paragraph{25. October, 15:28; Alice Springs}
So the weather forecast in Australia sucks.
We have arrived.
30°C - sunny.
We are roasting.
Using sun screen as marinade does not really help.
So we restocked on water.
And jerky.

Before feading on to Erldunda everyone donned an Australian leather hat to keep our brains from boiling over.
We also went to the Royal Flying Doctors of Australia museam.
Think REGA for Aussies.

Damn it is hot, the guy who invented air conditioning deserves a medal.

\paragraph{25. October, 15:40; Road to Erldunda}
We are driving on a straight road.
And I mean straight as in \emph{no bends whatsoever}.
We are passing signs that say "floodway"\ldots{}
There are depth indicators next to the road.
They go up to 2m.
I wonder if we should be concerned.

\paragraph{25. October, 22:25; Erldunda Station Bed and Breakfast}
We are now in the Outback.
Definitely.
No mobile phone reception.
The roads besides the main riad are nothing but dirt.
And there are bushes, shrubbery and dirt as far as the eye can see.
And it is hot.
Sunscreen reserves are dwindling quickly.
People are getting headaches.
Bottled water is expensive.

The night sky is beatiful.
You do not realize how much light pollution there is back home.
Not until you have seen the milky way with bare eyes.
There certainly is a price tag attached to progress.
Maybe the reason people stopped reaching for the stars is because they no longer see them.

We have seen lightning and what looked like fire in the distance.
Maybe tomorrow we will know what that is all about.
