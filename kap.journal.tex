\chapter{Chronicler's Log}

\paragraph{14. October, 7:15; Train to Lenzburg}
It was a dark and story night,\ldots well it \emph{was} dark.
The storm was busy elsewhere, or \emph{is}, if you prefer present tense.
Once again, the nagging feeling of having forgotten something important and having left that thing somewhere near the coffer, but not quite inside it, looms over the back of my head.
I silence it with wisdom.
As long as civilization holds, you need but a passport, a credit card and some language skills to survive.
Well, maybe a clean set of clothes helps.
Do not try to go into a store naked.
Though\ldots if they are real businesspeople they would just show you to the clothes department.

\paragraph{14. October, 11:30; Plane to Singapore}
We met up, checked in.
Security checks, passport control and passport control.
Still some of the daily life we are leaving stowed behind us clings to the conversations.

Now we are stuffed into the double layered plane.
Bottom layer.
Together with other sardines.
A ball of rice was consumed, tasted delicious but fleeting.
We now wait for departure, arrival, maybe the onset of oblivion.

There is not enough space to put all the cushion and covers you get handed in this thing.

Correction: If you store them under your seat, there is.

\paragraph{15. October, Darkness; Plane to Singapore}
We are somewhere above India, nearing the coast.
Though my travel screen is frozen over Georgia.
I am writing in the dark, the reading light is too bright to be sensitive; using the LCD screen backlight to write.
Or rather - a pen lit by said backlight.
Have not been able to sleep.
Have not found any good codenames for the crew either.
At least the toilet paper is safely stowed away.

Flying always seems surreal.
You can travel halfway around the globe.
In a day's time.
In 80 days around the world.
If I did remember the name of the guy who wrote it, I would be guessing him to be somewhat perplexed if he had known.
People always wanted to see the end of the world.
Turns out, the end of the world is right where you started.
Taunting you: "Wanna go again?"
Maybe it had been better if the world actually turned out to be a disc.

\paragraph{15. October, 5:10; Still on the plane}
Had breakfast, nothing to report.
Red October broke his entertainment system, something to report.

\paragraph{15. October, 17:30; Plane to Sydney}
After a sheer neverending cycle of breakfast-lunch eatery, we are finally nearly there.
Weather outside seems horribly bright.
Red October is getting sunburn just thinking about leaving the plane.
Well, the sky is blue and motivation is high.

\paragraph{15. October, 19:45; Car rental lot}
Aqcuired a van, spacey.
Met up with The Preceptress, the game is on.

We just got overtaken by a car sporting WOM 837 on the plate, emph{coincidence}?.

GPS navigation powered up, now navigating Sydney.

We now have a way description and a navigational system, cleary violating navigation 101: Never bring 2 compasses, either bring one or bring three.
If two compasses disagree, you never know which one to trust.

\paragraph{16. October, 0:10; Travelodge room 502}
First night in town, ate world's second greatest Burgers at \emph{grill'd Healthy Burgers}.
Finished up with cider and Cuba Libre, though our womenfolk only had a Margherita.

Though it was just a short night out, we already saw a smorgasboard of diversity:
Drag queens, gay people, women dressed in short skirts, all kinds of ethnicities.
Seems impossible to distinguish the natives from the tourists.

Though you can get liquor in most restaurants, some proudly proclaim BYO on liquor bottles, or wine for that matter.
This in its turn prompting businessmen to open bottle shops, where you can buy bottles, which are then brought to where you eat.

\paragraph{16. October, 12:10; The Rocks - Wharf 3}
Not that bright an idea, going sightseeing on a sunday.
The is booked tightly.
And we lost sight of The Bomber and The Gadgeteer during boarding.

\paragraph{16. October, 12:35; Ferry to Manly}
We're off on the waves.
Lining the coast.
Apartments and villas sprinkle the seaside hills.
Beaches and seas of boat masts hint at expensive living between the forested cliffs.

There is a nice view of the Opera House and that huge bridge of which nobody bothered to tell me the name.
Well, to be fair, I did not ask.

Now the coast line turns to cliffs, except those parts that look more like concealed fortification than natuarally occurring rock formations.

And there is sailing and buoys, maybe some are training for the next big regatta and others are just waiting for an opportunity to feed their rich husband to the sharks.

And then there is a speedboat, dashing from one ship's trail to another soaking its passengers in the ensuing spray as it goes.

I wonder whether estate prices for fish homes below have plummeted since they established the ferry lines.
After all, we are complaining about air plane noise in \emph{our} homes\ldots{}

\paragraph{16. October, 16:10; Manly Ferry to Sydney}
Spent an afternoon walking about Manly and eating spicy chicken.
Learned that swimming is discouraged for 24 hours after heavy rain due to pollution.
The nature of the pollution remained unknown.
The island's name is a near endless source of pun based humor and the local business and tourist organisations are tapping into it heavily.
I'm unsure whether by accident or deliberately.
Also, surfing seems to consist og 50\% waiting, 25\% standing on wood and 25\% falling into water.

\paragraph{16. October, 18:34; Travelodge room 502}
Returned, bought supplies, passed ny night noodle market, now waiting for organisation.
Excursion at 19:00.

\paragraph{16. October, 23:00; Travelodge room 502}
Waited to finish booking hotels, we seem to be traveling in-season, hotels are slightly overbooked.
Went for Thai food, delicious.
Red October got recognized by the owner, showed him an obviously Italian teddy bear.
Was able to save us by telling them we were Swiss.
He did not ask for a clock or chocolate.
Maybe he did not believe me.

Red October and The Bomber went drinking afterwards.
Now they are sitting in our room, cider in hand.
They forgot it is forbidden to drink in public\ldots{}

\paragraph{17. October, 11:15; On the road to Wagga Wagga}
After Sydney was done confusing the heck out of our navigation system, we are now trucking the countryside after leaving the suburbs.

Roadkill counters are steadily increasing.
Had 4 kangaroos and a wombat so far.

\paragraph{17. October, 11:30; Road through Jenolan Forest}
We are more or less the only car on the immediate road.

We are passing rolling hills, eucalyptus trees, pine trees, eucalyptus trees and pine trees.

\paragraph{17. October, 13:20; Jenolan Caves}
Gone spelunking, or near-spelunking.
There was a large cave, a dam with emerald waters - or maybe turquoise waters, who can tell these days.
There were eucalyptus trees in a large clearing further down the valley.
The Gadgeteer scared a dragon, then photographed it.
The rest just scared regular lizards.

Pecularity: Part of the walkway through the cave daoubled as road.
A sign advised us to use extreme care when passing.
Had only regular care at our disposal, survived nonetheless.

When we got back to the car, one of the guided tours was just starting.
They were calling for "chicken holders" - comedy ensued.

\texttt{>>> FILE ACCESS ERROR - MISSING IMAGE <<<}

\paragraph{17. October, 14:30; Oberon}
Picked up a sammitch, a pastie, two pies, two hamburgers and a chicken salad.

The pies will most likely end up in trash, leaving The Preceptress hungry and the chicken salad was a bit improvised.
Rest was good though.

Fascinatingly, parking forwards is prohibited.

\paragraph{17. October, 21:40; Motor Inn Wagga Wagga}
We arrived at sunset.
Tires digging through the gravel in the driveway.
Doors looked barred.
A few cars rust silently in the parking lot.
Our headlights fall dark.
Car doors slam shut.
Nobody notices our arrival but the cold evening breeze.
The outer door creaks as we enter.
The inner door slams shut.
A dark saloon looms beyond.
Chairs stored on the tables.
It was swept, dust had not yet settled in.
We walked past a flickering TV screen, sume kids rustled around.
Beyond, the reception desk.
We checked in.

Dinner at pub.
The Bomber fails to buy Skittles from a dispenser.
Outside LEDs hanging from a tree glitter in the night.

\texttt{>>> DISTANCE TRAVELED BY CAR: 600km - totals 600km <<<}

\paragraph{18. October, 9:40; Highway to Cooma}
This is cow country, the secret cow level, cowtopia, the great grazing grounds,
the place a good cow is reincarnated to when it has been made into enough delicious burgers.
In Switzerland we have a label "Freilandhaltung", when they are kept outside, on the field.
Compared to the rolling grasslands we pass now, where the cattlegrounds go on until they meet the horizon,
the label seems like a bad joke.

If you ever plan on reincarnating as a cow. Try to get a spot in Australia.
You are going to get eaten anyways.
Might as well choose a nice place to stay until that time.

\paragraph{18. October, 11:35; Black Perry Lookout}
We now have even seen \emph{live} cangaroos and emus and have made our way over the Snowy Mountain Road.

A quick stop at the lookout shows a lot of foresty mountainside.

\texttt{>>> FILE ACCESS ERROR - MISSING IMAGE <<<}

And we greeted old people which seem to follow plans analogous to ours.

Since we are going to drive onward now, I continue writing in the back seat while insane bikers pass by.
Should work, bit I notice my handwriting suffers during the bumpy ride.

One stop back we strolled down the side of a lake.
Fairytale weather and a tree which could have sprung from any jolly children's story later we were back on the road.

\paragraph{18. October, 13:40; Snake Trail}
We hit a snake trail, diverting from the highway to the left.
Gravel road is bumpy.

The pen rolled under the seats somewhere.
I am unable to find it, so I am using a pencil for this entry.

We ditched the plan to take the scenic drive along the mountainside.
Would have taken us the whole day just for the drive and no time for exploring.

So we went spelunking.
Big wet cold cave.
Contained a wig.
Entrance hall collapsed some time ago.
Owner did not come around to renovate.
Must have come on hard times - the lighting was sparse and most of the rooms were damp.
At least they had outdoor heated pool, but be skipped that.
Always prioritize food.
Just noticing.
If I keep this speed of logging up, I might fill the log book before wee are back out.

Maybe I should remember to hit an office supply shop for a spare paper blank.

The toilet paper is still untouched.

\paragraph{18. October, 15:00; Exiting Cabramurra}
At Australia's highest up village thae café closes it's kitchen at 1400.
We settled for Cup Noodles - well - some of us did.
The others maintian their sugar levels with sweets and candy bars.

We skipped photographing the town sign and I found my pen.

\texttt{>>> DISTANCE TRAVELED BY CAR: 275km - totals 875km <<<}

\paragraph{19. October, 9:00; Exiting Cooma}
Had delicious (and plentiful) dinner last night, followed by an attempt at wireless internet.

Wireless internet was slooow.
Too slow for Lotus Notes, preventing The Bomber to check his work mail.
Too slow for GMX, preventing Lady Roadkill to check her private mail.
Almost too slow for GMail enabling me to do reauthentification at snail's speed.

While I was logging we had our first road kill.
It might have been a good thing.
That Cuckaborra was too stupid for life.
Just waiting in the middle of the road, staring at the set of wheels approaching at high speeds.
Maybe it was suicidal.
Who knows.

\paragraph{19. October, 9:25; On the road}
I think we just passed a road called \emph{No Through Road}.

And we missed the exit to Springfield.

\paragraph{19. October, 12:22; Still on the road}
Driving, driving, driving - on roadkillless raods.
Passing meadows, fences, forests, sheep, cows, cars, horses, birds, traffic signs and concealed entrances.

Trying to point out to the others what I have dubbed \emph{Sheep Launch Pads}: Small ramps that are directed outwards from a corral and lead to virtually nowwhere.
Suppose they are intended to serve as a way to get sheep out to the meadow without giving them any way to come back.

\paragraph{19. October, 15:40; Mallacoota}
Starting to get the hang of Australian serving sizes.
Ordering a single meal or a large side usually is enough.

Took a stroll on the beach.
The Bomber and me were thwarted from crossing to the other shore by Six Meters Of Water.
Noticeable amounts of shell were discovered.
There was beautiful sea, sand and waves.
Work stress debuff starting to wear off.
The Cameraman took about 2 Minutes of me talking Irish on the shore.

No, I am not going to transcribe.

\paragraph{19. October, 17:15; Road to Lake's Entrance}
The sun is descending slowly on a sky barren of clouds.
As we pass the flickering shadows of the forest we plow through legions of insects swarming in the dry spring air.

\paragraph{19. October, 17:30; Fluffy Forest} 
Passing through a forest which seems to have burnt down.
However from the dead trunks the leaves just sprout once again.
The whole forest looks like green corran candy sticks.

\emph{It's so fluffy!}
