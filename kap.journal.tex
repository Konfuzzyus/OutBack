\chapter{Chronicler's Log}

\paragraph{14. October, 7:15; Train to Lenzburg}
It was a dark and story night,\ldots well it \emph{was} dark.
The storm was busy elsewhere, or \emph{is}, if you prefer present tense.
Once again, the nagging feeling of having forgotten something important and having left that thing somewhere near the coffer, but not quite inside it, looms over the back of my head.
I silence it with wisdom.
As long as civilization holds, you need but a passport, a credit card and some language skills to survive.
Well, maybe a clean set of clothes helps.
Do not try to go into a store naked.
Though\ldots if they are real businesspeople they would just show you to the clothes department.

\paragraph{14. October, 11:30; Plane to Singapore}
We met up, checked in.
Security checks, passport control and passport control.
Still some of the daily life we are leaving stowed behind us clings to the conversations.

Now we are stuffed into the double layered plane.
Bottom layer.
Together with other sardines.
A ball of rice was consumed, tasted delicious but fleeting.
We now wait for departure, arrival, maybe the onset of oblivion.

There is not enough space to put all the cushion and covers you get handed in this thing.

Correction: If you store them under your seat, there is.

\paragraph{15. October, Darkness; Plane to Singapore}
We are somewhere above India, nearing the coast.
Though my travel screen is frozen over Georgia.
I am writing in the dark, the reading light is too bright to be sensitive; using the LCD screen backlight to write.
Or rather - a pen lit by said backlight.
Have not been able to sleep.
Have not found any good codenames for the crew either.
At least the toilet paper is safely stowed away.

Flying always seems surreal.
You can travel halfway around the globe.
In a day's time.
In 80 days around the world.
If I did remember the name of the guy who wrote it, I would be guessing him to be somewhat perplexed if he had known.
People always wanted to see the end of the world.
Turns out, the end of the world is right where you started.
Taunting you: "Wanna go again?"
Maybe it had been better if the world actually turned out to be a disc.

\paragraph{15. October, 5:10; Still on the plane}
Had breakfast, nothing to report.
Red October broke his entertainment system, something to report.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c||}
\emph{Achievement unlocked}\\
"Tech Support!"\\
\multicolumn{1}{||p{0.8\textwidth}||}{\footnotesize - Brick the entertainment system on an A380} \\

\paragraph{15. October, 17:30; Plane to Sydney}
After a sheer neverending cycle of breakfast-lunch eatery, we are finally nearly there.
Weather outside seems horribly bright.
Red October is getting sunburn just thinking about leaving the plane.
Well, the sky is blue and motivation is high.

\paragraph{15. October, 19:45; Car rental lot}
Aqcuired a van, spacey.
Met up with The Preceptress, the game is on.

We just got overtaken by a car sporting WOM 837 on the plate, emph{coincidence}?.

GPS navigation powered up, now navigating Sydney.

We now have a way description and a navigational system, cleary violating navigation 101: Never bring 2 compasses, either bring one or bring three.
If two compasses disagree, you never know which one to trust.

\paragraph{16. October, 0:10; Travelodge room 502}
First night in town, ate world's second greatest Burgers at \emph{grill'd Healthy Burgers}.
Finished up with cider and Cuba Libre, though our womenfolk only had a Margherita.

Though it was just a short night out, we already saw a smorgasboard of diversity:
Drag queens, gay people, women dressed in short skirts, all kinds of ethnicities.
Seems impossible to distinguish the natives from the tourists.

Though you can get liquor in most restaurants, some proudly proclaim BYO on liquor bottles, or wine for that matter.
This in its turn prompting businessmen to open bottle shops, where you can buy bottles, which are then brought to where you eat.

\paragraph{16. October, 12:10; The Rocks - Wharf 3}
Not that bright an idea, going sightseeing on a sunday.
The is booked tightly.
And we lost sight of The Bomber and The Gadgeteer during boarding.

\paragraph{16. October, 12:35; Ferry to Manly}
We're off on the waves.
Lining the coast.
Apartments and villas sprinkle the seaside hills.
Beaches and seas of boat masts hint at expensive living between the forested cliffs.

There is a nice view of the Opera House and that huge bridge of which nobody bothered to tell me the name.
Well, to be fair, I did not ask.

Now the coast line turns to cliffs, except those parts that look more like concealed fortification than natuarally occurring rock formations.

And there is sailing and buoys, maybe some are training for the next big regatta and others are just waiting for an opportunity to feed their rich husband to the sharks.

And then there is a speedboat, dashing from one ship's trail to another soaking its passengers in the ensuing spray as it goes.

I wonder whether estate prices for fish homes below have plummeted since they established the ferry lines.
After all, we are complaining about air plane noise in \emph{our} homes\ldots{}

\paragraph{16. October, 16:10; Manly Ferry to Sydney}
Spent an afternoon walking about Manly and eating spicy chicken.
Learned that swimming is discouraged for 24 hours after heavy rain due to pollution.
The nature of the pollution remained unknown.
The island's name is a near endless source of pun based humor and the local business and tourist organisations are tapping into it heavily.
I'm unsure whether by accident or deliberately.
Also, surfing seems to consist og 50\% waiting, 25\% standing on wood and 25\% falling into water.

\paragraph{16. October, 18:34; Travelodge room 502}
Returned, bought supplies, passed ny night noodle market, now waiting for organisation.
Excursion at 19:00.

\paragraph{16. October, 23:00; Travelodge room 502}
Waited to finish booking hotels, we seem to be traveling in-season, hotels are slightly overbooked.
Went for Thai food, delicious.
Red October got recognized by the owner, showed him an obviously Italian teddy bear.
Was able to save us by telling them we were Swiss.
He did not ask for a clock or chocolate.
Maybe he did not believe me.

Red October and The Bomber went drinking afterwards.
Now they are sitting in our room, cider in hand.
They forgot it is forbidden to drink in public\ldots{}
