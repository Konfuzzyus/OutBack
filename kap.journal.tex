\chapter{Chronicler's Log}

\paragraph{14. October, 7:15; Train to Lenzburg}
It was a dark and story night,\ldots well it \emph{was} dark.
The storm was busy elsewhere, or \emph{is}, if you prefer present tense.
Once again, the nagging feeling of having forgotten something important and having left that thing somewhere near the coffer, but not quite inside it, looms over the back of my head.
I silence it with wisdom.
As long as civilization holds, you need but a passport, a credit card and some language skills to survive.
Well, maybe a clean set of clothes helps.
Do not try to go into a store naked.
Though\ldots if they are real businesspeople they would just show you to the clothes department.

\paragraph{14. October, 11:30; Plane to Singapore}
We met up, checked in.
Security checks, passport control and passport control.
Still some of the daily life we are leaving stowed behind us clings to the conversations.

Now we are stuffed into the double layered plane.
Bottom layer.
Together with other sardines.
A ball of rice was consumed, tasted delicious but fleeting.
We now wait for departure, arrival, maybe the onset of oblivion.

There is not enough space to put all the cushion and covers you get handed in this thing.

Correction: If you store them under your seat, there is.

\paragraph{15. October, Darkness; Plane to Singapore}
We are somewhere above India, nearing the coast.
Though my travel screen is frozen over Georgia.
I am writing in the dark, the reading light is too bright to be sensitive; using the LCD screen backlight to write.
Or rather - a pen lit by said backlight.
Have not been able to sleep.
Have not found any good codenames for the crew either.
At least the toilet paper is safely stowed away.

Flying always seems surreal.
You can travel halfway around the globe.
In a day's time.
In 80 days around the world.
If I did remember the name of the guy who wrote it, I would be guessing him to be somewhat perplexed if he had known.
People always wanted to see the end of the world.
Turns out, the end of the world is right where you started.
Taunting you: "Wanna go again?"
Maybe it had been better if the world actually turned out to be a disc.

\paragraph{15. October, 5:10; Still on the plane}
Had breakfast, nothing to report.
Red October broke his entertainment system, something to report.

\paragraph{15. October, 17:30; Plane to Sydney}
After a sheer neverending cycle of breakfast-lunch eatery, we are finally nearly there.
Weather outside seems horribly bright.
Red October is getting sunburn just thinking about leaving the plane.
Well, the sky is blue and motivation is high.

\paragraph{15. October, 19:45; Car rental lot}
Aqcuired a van, spacey.
Met up with the Preceptress, the game is on.

We just got overtaken by a car sporting WOM 837 on the plate, emph{coincidence}?.

GPS navigation powered up, now navigating Sydney.

We now have a way description and a navigational system, cleary violating navigation 101: Never bring 2 compasses, either bring one or bring three.
If two compasses disagree, you never know which one to trust.
